## Welcome

This repository houses the source for `json-everything` documentation site, https://docs.json-everything.net.

## Contributing

We're happy to accept and review issues and PRs regarding the content of the documentation.  As is the way of things, it can always be improved.

The API Reference docs are automatically generated by the [ApiDocsGenerator tool](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything/tree/master/tools/ApiDocsGenerator) the main repository and synced here.  Changes to the API Reference docs should be made there.

The main project's [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) also applies.

## Running locally

The site is a standard [Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) using a modified [Chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/).

You'll need to install the dependencies listed in the GitHub docs to run it locally.  Once all of the dependencies are available, you can run the `run.bat` or `run.sh` scripts to more easily start up the site.

Because of the API docs, the building the entire site will take a few seconds, so running the site with an incremental build is recommended.

## Style

Please see the [Chirpy theme site](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) for examples of the markdown that's supported.
