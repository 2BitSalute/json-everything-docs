# [1.0.2](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/621) {#release-e-1.0.2}

Updated string indexing to look at text elements instead of chars to better support surrogate pairs.

`split()` function now properly returns source string when split char is not provided.

`$let` operator now errors if `in` is not provided.

# [1.0.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/569) {#release-e-1.0.1}

Improved error messaging so that it's closer in alignment with other implementations.

# [1.0.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/566) {#release-e-1.0.0}

Initial release.
